If you follow these insanely easy steps you will be able to drive on a beautiful new map 
produced by no other than Andreea Fulger. 

1. In this folder you recieved you should see a file called "Island.zip". It might have a different name
but dont worry, the folder should only contain: A readMe file, a picture and the ".zip" file. 
Whatever name it has, it should end with ".zip". 

2. I want you to locate your SMCE folder. It is super easy! Go to your search bar on your computer
and search one of the following, depending on your computer: 

Windows: %APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\SMCE
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Godot/SMCE
Linux: ~/.local/share/godot/SMCE

You found it? Good! 

3. Now there should be a folder called "mods" there. Go ahead and open it! 

4. Is it empty? Dont worry! This is completely normal. It happens to everyone! 
Now I want you to drag the "Island.zip" file and put in the mods folder. 

5. YOU DID IT! Go ahead and run your SMCE Godot program. 

6. Start one of your profiles. 

7. In the very top left corner there is a "=" symbol. Go ahead and click on it. 

8. There should be a curtain selection button next to "World:". Right now the selected world is
"playground/Playground". Go ahead and press on it to see your world options! 

9. There should be an option called "isle/Isle". Click on it!  

10. When you clicked on it, a new map should appear and you are ready to test it out! 

Good job!
