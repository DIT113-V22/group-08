For this to work well you need to make sure you have our special customized release of the SMCE-Godot. Go [here](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/smce-gd-group-08/actions/runs/2400632985#artifacts) and choose the right option for your system. If unsure check the [setup instructions](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/group-08/wiki/Setup-Guides).
Now you're good to go

Download the _Island.pck_ file from our releases page and paste it into the _mods_ folder in your SMCE user data folder. This can be found at:
* %APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\SMCE\mods (PC)
* ~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/SMCE/mods (MAC)

If you have other files present in the folder you don't need to remove them, just be careful not to overwrite anything important.

Get folders _smartcar_ and _finish_line_ from the Arduino module and paste them as they are in the main location where Arduino folders are created on your computer. Replace _smartcar_ folder if prompted as this version contains vehicle configuration as well.

Start the emulator and select the Isle/Isle environment from the dropdown menu in the top left corner. Add the two vehicles by clicking the + sign located under the drop down menu you clicked before. Assign the two sketches, compile them and press _Start_. 
You can save the profile and have the environment as the default choice.

For the _Exploration Mode_ similarly start the emulator with a new profile and select the Exploration/Exploration environment from the dropdown menu in the top left corner. Add vehicles by clicking the + sign located under the drop down menu you clicked before. Assign the sketches, compile them and press _Start_. 
You can save the profile as well and have the environment as a second choice.

Enjoy!
